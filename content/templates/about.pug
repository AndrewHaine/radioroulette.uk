    h2 Future developments
    p There are a number of features I'd like to add to Radio Roulette in the future (granted the traffic is worth the time). The following features are planned for the near future:
    ul
      li Increase stations database to include more local and community stations
      li Filtering for radio types
      li Embedded players
      li Categorising radios based on content and adding filters
      li Including Spotify radios and popular playlists
